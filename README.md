# IoT Programming and Networking Projects

The projects in this repository were created using the Cisco Packet Tracer simulator provided by cisco. Packet Tracer is a free, easy-to-use tool that allows you to simulate networks and devices. You can use Packet Tracer to create your projects because it is a great way to learn about IoT programming and networking without having to use real hardware.

* Creating a simple network
* Connecting to a Home Gateway and Monitoring Network
* Adding IoT devices to the Network
* Programming an MCU to blink some LEDs
* Exploring the Smart Home
* Configuring Wireless Security
